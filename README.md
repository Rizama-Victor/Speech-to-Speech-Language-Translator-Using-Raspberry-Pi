# Speech-to-Speech 🗣️ Language Translator Using Raspberry Pi

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Speech-to-Speech Language Translator** is a portable device designed to make communication across Nigerian Spoken languages seamless. It captures voice input through a microphone,  translates it using the machine learning model [Spitch](https://spi-tch.com/), and plays the translated speech through a speaker. To promote user interaction, the text is displayed on an I2C LCD screen, providing a clear visual representation.

Built on a Raspberry Pi and housed in a 3D-printed casing, the device combines functionality with portability. This project bridges the fields of machine learning and embedded systems, offering a seamless solution for real-time language translation. Whether you're traveling, participating in international meetings, or simply engaging in conversations across languages, the translator provides an intuitive and effective way to communicate.

## 🖨️ 3D Printing

### 🎨 Designing the 3D Casing
To design the enclosure, Fusion 360 was used for 3D modeling. The design was printed using the Prusa i3 Mk 3 3D printer, and additional structural parts were cut using the Epilog laser cutter.

The final device case dimensions are 87.5 mm in height, 140 mm in length, and 100 mm in width. The compact size of the case allows for an easy-to-use interface while housing all components securely, making it portable and user-friendly for everyday use.

## How It Works

### 🔗 API Integration

The Speech-to-Speech Language Translator device uses [Spitch](https://spi-tch.com/), a natural language processing model hosted on a backend server. The translation process works by first transcribing the speech to text, then translating it to the target language, and finally converting the translated text back into speech in the target language. The API allows seamless interaction with the model while performing these steps to translate the spoken language.

### Supported Languages
The API supports transcription and translation for the following languages:
- Hausa
- Yoruba
- Igbo
- English
  
**Note:** In this application, the project focused on Translation of Hausa to English.

### Workflow
- **Speech-to-Text**: The system starts by first recording the user's speech input in Hausa using the microphone. The recorded audio in `.wav` format is then sent via the API as an input to the [Spitch model](https://spi-tch.com/) for transcription into Hausa text.
- **Translation**: The model then translates the transcribed Hausa text into English text.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Finally, the translated English text is then converted back into an audio file in `.wav` format, which is played aloud through the speaker using an agent's voice (lucy). The translated text is also displayed on the LCD screen for visual interaction.

Other Agent Voices Available Include: john, lina, and jude.

For more detailed information on the API, its features, please refer to the [Spitch Documentation](https://docs.spi-tch.com/getting-started/welcome).

## 🏁 Conclusion

The Speech-to-Speech Language Translator is a prototype that enables real-time translation from Hausa to English. While this is the first version, there is great potential for future improvements, such as adding support for more languages, improving translation accuracy, and reducing the overall size. This project showcases the possibility of using readily available hardware to overcome language barriers, opening up many exciting opportunities for future development.
